###### Viz 1:

Good:
- Colors vary enough so that the user can easily distinguish between bars
- Easy to see which product is best for each strategy
- Is a bar chart (mostly)

Bad:
- No values at top of bars
- Two Y-Axes (Line is not the sum of bars)
- "Total of Amount"
- Values are in terms of what?

---
###### Viz 2:

Good:
- Is a bar chart (mostly)

Bad:
- Too many categories makes differentiating between colors a pain
- Unsure what red/blue number and percentages mean
- Y axis not labeled
- Space where the thousands separator (usually a comma) should go
- Percentages don't correlate to bar values (some are negative?)
- Image is blurry
- Some data missing percentages

---
###### Viz 3:

- Has some bars somewhere
- Is colored in traditional Halloween colors


Bad:
- Has circles
- Has random graphics (that are also circles)
- 'Greetings cards' has no values
- Pumpkin size not consistent
- Circle size impossible to tell difference in size
- Bars have no values
- Candy corn in top corners does not have transparent background
- No description of population (annual spending by who?)

###### Alt 1:
A stacked bar chart is a better way to compare both individual products as well
as totals. With this method, you can still see how each product fares in each
strategy (not only by visuals but also by numbers), but now the total bar length
as well as the number at the top of each bar remove the need for a 'total' line.
A more descriptive Y axis title also helps be more clear as to what the graph is
referring to.

###### Alt 2:
Two options are presented here. Since I assume the graph is trying to compare
cold/throat diseases as well as remedies used, it makes sense to split up the data
that way. Option one is to separate the types into separate charts - here being cold
and throat. However I made sure to keep the axes the same in order to prevent confusion.

Option 2 is to combine them on the same graph, which is what I did with the remedies,
and have the different categories color coded. The caveat here is that you don't want
to bog down the charts with too much data, so this might not always be and option.

###### Alt 3:
For #3 I was aiming for something interactive. Since a lot of the data they display
is dependent on one another, having some way to navigate between them could be pretty
cool. Normally a stacked bar chart similar to #1 would be effective here, but Since
the data is broken down multiple times, this would likely yield too many bars stacked.

Instead, I propose a click/zoom feature, where if you click on a year, it zooms in
and makes a graph of how people collectively spent money that year as its own bar
chart. Then the user could further filter the data (for example, by costume here)
with another zoom. Alternatively, there could be a pair of dropdown menus or
radio buttons that allow the user to filter their data to their liking.
