### Max Pohlman

##### Assignment Three

---

###### Viz Critique:

Good:

* Lots of relevant information
* Tells an effective story without much narrative

Bad:

* "Dripping blood" effect a bit tacky
* Too easy to ignore coalition death histogram
* Two 'biggest killer' circles overlap
* Greyscale generally appears drab (they're trying to get the blood to stand out more I guess)
* Text is small/hard to read
* Diverse types of data don't necessarily need a diverse set of visualizations

###### Alternative

Since there's a common metric amongst all of these visualizations (except ground troops), I think it would make sense to keep deaths constant on the y axis and allow the user to change what they view on the x. This cleans up the graphic and would allow for a more easy comparison between metrics, rather than having the user try and match bar length with pie slice area.
