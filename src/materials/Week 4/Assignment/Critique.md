###### Viz Critique:

Good:
- Numbers next to each other allow easy comparison
- Colors match party


Bad:
- Topic title bounces between left and right
- Hard to compare bar length on opposite side of axes
- No axis labels

###### Alternative

I pretty much just ran last week back. Categorical grouped bar chart, individual
'topics' on the X axis with Dem/Rep colored bars right next to each other. Text
at the top of bars to keep the good numeric comparison.
