###### Viz Critique:

Good:
- Not a TON of ink...
- Easy to compare months


Bad:
- Two axes make things confusing
- Line on top of bars makes things confusing
- Numbers at the top can cause confusion as to which axes they're referring to
- Feb dot on top of number
- Bars are 'Number of Orders' on axes and 'OrderID' in legend
- (last year) -> 2014
- Once specified it's 2014, remove year from x axis labels.
- 'Amount of Sales' -> 'Revenue'

###### Alternative

If a comparison is what the user is after, one way to go about this is to
standardize the data. In my example, I plotted the difference each month was
from the respective measurement's yearly average. This creates a nice metric that can be used
to compare the two statistics, even though one was in the hundreds and the other
was in the hundreds of thousands. You can now more clearly see trends like, for example, in Jan/Feb they were
selling lots of inexpensive products while in Jul/Aug they were selling more expensive
products.
