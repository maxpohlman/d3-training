##### Assignment Two

###### Viz 1:

Good:
- Has a lot of relevant data that (if presented clearly) be very useful to the
user


Bad:
- Many different types of visualizations
- Some topics are similar, some are different
- Has tables
- Has pie charts
- Has "product" and "region" titles for menu that changes date

---
###### Viz 2:

Good:
- Is broken down into separate visualizations for each product

Bad:
- Has pie charts
- Line chart is too clustered
- Bars on top of lines makes it very hard to read
- Looks like it was designed with geocities
- Questionable Y axis labels
- No idea what 'columns' are
---
###### Viz 3:

- Focuses on effectively presenting one metric rather than bloating the vis up
with 15 different metrics
- Descriptive titles
- Sort of thematic
- Bars are labeled with percentages


Bad:
- +1 Month should be 1+ Month
- Saints colors are gold, not blue
- Yard markers can be confused with axes
- White on grey text could used a black border
- Hard to tell which bars correspond to which
- Regular season should run through Feb?

###### Alts 1 and 2:

The main problem with both of these visualizations was that there was too much
data thrown at the user at once. In my proposed alternatives, the user is granted
the ability to select the data he or she wants to view. The options to the left
of the chart provide a method for the user to create the comparisons that are
most impactful to them. This takes some of the burden off of the designer as
he or she no longer has to figure out how to please every party of viewers. The
only problem with this is that it requires very precise/high resolution data since it is being
filtered/aggregated multiple times.

###### Alt 3:
For #3 I tried to improve the readability of the visualization without taking
too much away from its cool theme. Thus I kept the green/white of a football field
and changed the Saints' bar to their team color. Also since I'm sure that fans
of other teams might be interested in this data, the option to select/view other
teams should be added. Perhaps some feature where you can compare two teams versus
each other instead of individually versus the average would be pretty neat. Another
interesting metric would be comparing the same team across multiple years. Many
different routes to take/ways to further improve.
