##### Assignment Two

---
###### Viz 1:

Good:
- Has a lot of relevant data that (if presented clearly) be very useful to the
user


Bad:
- Many different types of visualizations
- Some topics are similar, some are different
- Has tables
- Has pie charts
- Has "product" and "region" titles for menu that changes date

---
###### Viz 2:

Good:
- Is broken down into separate visualizations for each product

Bad:
- Has pie charts
- Line chart is too clustered
- Bars on top of lines makes it very hard to read
- Looks like it was designed with geocities
- Questionable Y axis labels
- No idea what 'columns' are
---
###### Viz 3:

- Focuses on effectively presenting one metric rather than bloating the vis up
with 15 different metrics
- Descriptive titles
- Sort of thematic
- Bars are labeled with percentages


Bad:
- +1 Month should be 1+ Month
- Saints colors are gold, not blue
- Yard markers can be confused with axes
- White on grey text could used a black border
- Hard to tell which bars correspond to which
- Regular season should run through Feb?

###### Alt 1:
A stacked bar chart is a better way to compare both individual products as well
as totals. With this method, you can still see how each product fares in each
strategy (not only by visuals but also by numbers), but now the total bar length
as well as the number at the top of each bar remove the need for a 'total' line.
A more descriptive Y axis title also helps be more clear as to what the graph is
referring to.

###### Alt 2:
Two options are presented here. Since I assume the graph is trying to compare
cold/throat diseases as well as remedies used, it makes sense to split up the data
that way. Option one is to separate the types into separate charts - here being cold
and throat. However I made sure to keep the axes the same in order to prevent confusion.

Option 2 is to combine them on the same graph, which is what I did with the remedies,
and have the different categories color coded. The caveat here is that you don't want
to bog down the charts with too much data, so this might not always be and option.

###### Alt 3:
For #3 I was aiming for something interactive. Since a lot of the data they display
is dependent on one another, having some way to navigate between them could be pretty
cool. Normally a stacked bar chart similar to #1 would be effective here, but Since
the data is broken down multiple times, this would likely yield too many bars stacked.

Instead, I propose a click/zoom feature, where if you click on a year, it zooms in
and makes a graph of how people collectively spent money that year as its own bar
chart. Then the user could further filter the data (for example, by costume here)
with another zoom. Alternatively, there could be a pair of dropdown menus or
radio buttons that allow the user to filter their data to their liking.
